RLS:
Create 3 different users and roles
1. user:usa-user (us_users) (+Gamma) [datasource access on [MySQL].[salesjan](id:26)]
2. user:aus-user (aus_users) (+Gamma) [datasource access on [MySQL].[salesjan](id:26)]
3. user:all_others (other_users) (+Gamma) [datasource access on [MySQL].[salesjan](id:26)]

ie, first create users and add Gamma role.
    then create roles and assign roles the permissions.
    Then edit users to also have newly created roles.

Login as one of the user and check the accesses the user has.

1. Regular Filter
It is very simple filter in which filter clause is applied to the table for the users added in this RLS filter. 
It means if you add any user in this group whatever conditions are applied will be added to the where clause of the table.

2. Base Filter
This is kind of a inverse filter. That means where clause will be applied to all the users except to those 
users who care added to this filter.

What is "Group Key"?
If user is part of multiple RLS groups then if Group Key of these groups will come into consideration. 
If group key is same then filters will be OR in where clause and if the key is different then 
AND operation will be applied on filters.


Now edit RLS >

Filter type: Regular
Tables: salesjan
Roles: us-users
Group key: 
Clause : n_name = "UNITED STATES"

Note** whatever s passed in clause will be applied as where clause for all the users who belong to a particular role specified.

similarly add rules for other users.
