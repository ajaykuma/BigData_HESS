#Task
Access one of your previously created Dashboards
For example: TestDB4
--Contains chart : salesjan_with_coordinates
Click on edit dashboard > create new chart 
line chart >

query:
X-axis: Transaction_date
Time_grain: Day
Metrics: count(*)
Dimensions: Payment_types
Filters: None

in customize: show value (selected)

create chart > save it in TestDB4 as 'comparision_of_payment_types_overtime'

--------------
#Adding filter

--filter at chart level
Now access dashboard, choose newly created chart and edit chart
we can add a filter to chart if needed such as
payment_type!='Diners'

--filter at dashboard level (with variant scope)

Remember when we created chart tht had Product, Price , and metric as count.
Later we added a metric ('countryspecs' > CountrySpecs > country='United States'.
Note this metric will now be available for all datasets users.
Here Dimensions: Product, Price & Country
Metrics: Count(*), CountrySpecs
saved in > TestDB4  as 'Product_n_price_count'

#Task
We can also add/edit filters by left option on dashboard.
Click and add filter: 
Value type: Value
(other options include: Numerical range, time range, time column, time grain )
Filtername:PriceTime
Dataset: salesjan
Column: Price

Filter configuration:
Pre-filter available values
'Price is not null'

We can additional also give time range
Or add time range  > advanced
Start time: (included in time range)
DATEADD(DATETIME("2024-05-15T00:00:00"), -7, day)
End time( exluded from time range)
2025-05-15T00:00:00

or

 add time range > advanced
'Last 2 years'
> Apply

Click on scope tab to select scope of this filter.
<save>

Test filter : by provding one or multiple values in filter
say: Price value being 1800, 1200 and check.

====================
We can also edit dashboard to have multiple tabs and then
change scoping of filter accordingly.

remove freq chart from main and add it to new tab 
and change scope of filter

Similarly for travel bookings data:

#Task
Adding additional filters at dashboard level
Click on open TestDB5
add/edit filter and edit settings + scoping
Filter type: value
filter name: price
dataset: travelbookings
column: price_per_night
select : pre-filter available values
price_per_night > 50
time range: none

we can also choose
Filter has default value
filter value is required( user must select value)
Select first filter value by default(default cannt be selected)
& other settings

OR even
Now edit filter : add time range > advanced
'Last 2 years'
> Apply

<save>

Now test.. filter
