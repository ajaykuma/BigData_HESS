Feature Flags in Apache Superset
--------------
A feature flag, in the simplest of terms, is a software development technique that allows developers to turn features or 
functionality on and off at runtime without deploying new code. Apache Superset is full of these feature flags, 
enabling developers (and sometimes customers, in the case of Preset) to control the enabling or release of new features 
to specific deployments or groups of users. This allows developers or test new functionality, and easily roll back problematic changes.

In Superset, we have a whole slew of settings available to those who maintain or deploy instances of Superset. 
These are all found in the config.py file 

Feature flags are boolean. We’re simply flipping things on and off. If there’s some more detailed configuration object, 
parameters to set, etc., then it’s simply not a flag.

Flags affect the user experience. This is to say that there are plenty of boolean settings elsewhere in the config, 
but these are used to configure how Superset operates under the hood, usually to change how Superset is deployed, 
rather than how it’s presented to the end user.

DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS = True,
"DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS": True

or
FEATURE_FLAGS = {

    'DRILL_BY': True,

}
